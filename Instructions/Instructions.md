Build me a Python GUI application for downloading videos from multiple websites. The app should have the following features:

##Core Functionality:

Support downloading videos from sites like YouTube and others using libraries such as pytube and yt-dlp.
Allow users to choose video formats (e.g., MP4, WEBM) and resolutions (e.g., 720p, 1080p).
Enable users to select a custom save location for the downloaded files.


##User Interface:

Use Tkinter for the GUI, styled with modern themes (e.g., ttk or tkinter-ttk-bootstrap) for a clean, modern look.
Include fields for the video URL, format selection, resolution selection, and a "Download" button.
Display progress feedback, such as a progress bar, for ongoing downloads.

##Error Handling:

Handle common errors like unsupported sites, failed downloads, or connection issues gracefully.
Provide meaningful error messages to the user.


##Maintainability:

Ensure the app is modular and easy to update for adding new features or supporting additional sites in the future.
Use clear, well-documented code to aid in future modifications.
Platform:

The app should be compatible with both Windows and Mac OS.
